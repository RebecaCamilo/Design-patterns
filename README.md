# Design Patterns
Design patterns are recurring solutions to common problems that arise during software development. 
They represent the best practices employed by developers over time to address these issues.

## Types of design patterns
According to the [refactoring guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns), there are three main types of design patterns:

1. **Creational Patterns** 

   Creational patterns deal with the process of creating objects, providing mechanisms to create objects in a way that is 
flexible, efficient, and adaptable to changes.

4. **Structural Patterns** 

   Structural patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects, aiding in forming more complex structures from 
simple components.

6. **Behavioral Patterns** 

   Behavioral patterns deal with algorithms and responsibilities among objects. They help define how objects interact and 
communicate with each other.


## Design Patterns Proof of Concept (POCs) Project in Java
This repository contains a series of small projects in Java, each demonstrating the practical implementation of a specific 
design pattern. The goal is to provide a deeper understanding of design patterns and how to apply them in real-world 
situations.

### Repository Structure
Each directory in this repository represents an independent POC project for a specific design pattern. Within each 
directory, you will find a detailed README explaining the purpose of the pattern, execution instructions, and usage 
examples.
